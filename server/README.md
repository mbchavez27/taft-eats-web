## Getting Started

All dependencies are installed during the project setup. To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start with hot-reloading, meaning it will automatically restart when you save a file.

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
-   `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the `dist` directory.
